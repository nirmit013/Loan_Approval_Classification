# Loan Approval Classification Project

## 📌 Overview
This project predicts loan approval decisions using machine learning models.  
We analyzed a dataset of **45,000 loan applications with 14 features** (demographics, financials, credit history, etc.) and applied multiple classifiers.

## 🔍 Key Highlights
- Baseline logistic regression achieved **78.04% accuracy**
- Advanced models (XGBoost, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, SVM, etc.)
- **XGBoost with preprocessing** achieved the best performance at **94.12% accuracy**
- Applied preprocessing: outlier capping, categorical encoding, and SMOTE
- Report includes business implications, fairness audit, and deployment considerations
